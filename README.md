### Introduction
Diabetes affects millions globally, presenting significant health risks. Our project explores diabetes risk factors using sophisticated analytics on large datasets, aiming to enhance understanding and inform interventions. By analyzing various health, lifestyle, and socio-demographic factors, we aim to uncover complex patterns and connections that contribute to diabetes susceptibility.  We have considered a comprehensive dataset aimed at understanding diabetes dynamics through data analytics. The dataset encompasses a wide array of health-related factors, lifestyle choices, socio-demographic information, and self-reported health statuses. With over 250k+ records, it provides a robust foundation for our analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Target Variable:** Indicates diabetes status (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Prediabetes, 2 = Diabetes).
- **Health Indicators:** Includes high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and body mass index (BMI).
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Covers smoking status, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and heavy alcohol consumption.
- **Healthcare Access:** Addresses the presence of healthcare coverage and avoidance of doctor visits due to cost.
- **Self-Reported Health Status:** Captures general health perception, mental health, physical health, and difficulty with walking or climbing stairs.
- **Demographic Information:** Includes gender, age category, education level, and income level.

## Analysis Potential
This dataset offers rich opportunities for exploring correlations between various factors and diabetes risk. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, we aim to uncover complex patterns and relationships within the data. Insights derived from this analysis will inform targeted interventions, public health initiatives, and policy formulations aimed at combating diabetes and improving population health outcomes.

#### Objectives

1. **Identifying Predictive Factors**: Analyze health indicators and lifestyle factors to identify robust predictors of diabetes risk. By leveraging advanced statistical modeling techniques, we aim to uncover the most influential factors contributing to diabetes susceptibility and provide actionable insights for targeted interventions.

2. **Understanding Demographic Impact**: Investigate how socio-demographic factors influence diabetes prevalence across diverse groups. Through detailed demographic analysis, we seek to identify disparities in diabetes prevalence and understand the underlying factors contributing to these differences, informing strategies for equitable healthcare delivery.

3. **Exploring Behavioral Associations**: Uncover associations between behavioral factors and diabetes risk across demographics. By examining lifestyle choices, including diet, physical activity, and smoking, we aim to elucidate the impact of behavioral patterns on diabetes risk and develop tailored interventions to promote healthier lifestyles.


#### Proposed System

Our system integrates advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and visualization techniques to extract actionable insights from large-scale health datasets. By leveraging technologies such as PySpark, Spark MLlib, and Databricks DBFS, we ensure efficient data processing and analysis, enabling timely decision-making and intervention planning.

#### System Architecture

Our system architecture encompasses robust data ingestion, processing, NoSQL database utilization, advanced analytics engine, and result visualization components. By adopting a distributed computing approach and leveraging scalable technologies, we ensure seamless handling of large volumes of data and facilitate interactive exploration of results.

#### Proposed Development Platforms

We utilize Python, SQL, PySpark, Spark MLlib, and Databricks DBFS for developing our project, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets. By leveraging the capabilities of these platforms, we aim to streamline development workflows and accelerate the delivery of actionable insights for diabetes management and prevention.

#### Project Tasks and Timeline

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 7 days
2. **Feature Selection and Engineering**: 14 days
3. **Model Development and Evaluation**: 20 days
4. **Deployment and Documentation**: 4 days

#### Project Management Timeline

**Start Date:** 03/03/2024  
**End Date:** 04/12/2024  
**Total Duration:** 6 weeks

## Identify Risks and a Mitigation Plan
Potential risks include data quality issues, algorithmic complexity, and time constraints. To mitigate these risks, the team plans to:
- Conduct thorough data validation and cleansing during preprocessing.
- Prioritize essential features and algorithms during development to manage complexity.
- Monitor project progress closely and adjust timelines or resources if needed to ensure timely completion.

## Conclusion and Ongoing Development
Since the project is still in development, we will continue to add more findings and visuals as we progress. At the end of the project, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of diabetes risk factors and their implications.
